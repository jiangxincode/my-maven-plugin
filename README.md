# Simian Maven Plugin

`simian-maven-plugin` is a maven plugin for simian. You can visit <http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian> for further information of simian.

There is a `maven-simian-plugin`(http://maven.apache.org/archives/maven-1.x/plugins/simian/), however it can only be used in maven 1.x, so I write the `simian-maven-plugin` for maven 2+

This project is not fully finished, but spring is coming.

## License

`simian-maven-plugin` is a completely open-source project but simian is not. So you must read the license of it: <http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian/license.pdf>
