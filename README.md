# Simian Maven Plugin

`simian-maven-plugin` is a maven plugin for `simian`. You can visit <http://www.harukizaemon.com/simian> for further information of `simian`.

There is a `maven-simian-plugin`(http://maven.apache.org/archives/maven-1.x/plugins/simian), however it can be used in maven 1.x only, so I write the `simian-maven-plugin` for maven 2+.

This project is not fully finished, but spring is coming.
